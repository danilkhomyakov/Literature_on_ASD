#### Abstract

This study aimed to extend Lee and Hobson's (1998) findings regarding self-conceptualisation in autism by using a more verbally able sample. The study also investigated the ability to conceptualise self through other. Sixteen typically developing and sixteen adolescents with ASD matched for chronological and verbal mental age were administered a modified version of Damon and Hart's (1988) self-as-subject interview, which also required participants to conceptualise themselves from another's perspective. Self-conceptualisation ability was similar between groups across the categories of distinctiveness and continuity, but reduced in the ASD group under the category of agency. Participants with ASD were, however, less able to conceptualise themselves from another's perspective. These results are discussed in relation to second-person processes and narrative abilities.

In the last few decades research in autism has been dominated by studies investigating theory of mind ability (ToM), defined as the ability to understand the mental states of oneself and others (Premack and Woodruff, 1978). Whilst a wealth of research has demonstrated reduced ability for understanding the mental states of others (e.g., Baron-Cohen, 2001) the investigation of the ability of people with ASD to understand their own mental states has been relatively neglected, proving to be far more contentious with methodological and conceptual issues preventing clear operationalisation and interpretation of data (Zahavi and Parnas, 2003).

One of the earlier studies investigating self-understanding in autism (Lee and Hobson, 1998) employed the self-understanding interview developed by Damon and Hart (1988). This interview protocol utilises the

Jamesian (1890) distinction between the self-as-object, or, 'me'-characterised by objective attributes of the self- and the self-as-subject or 'I', which corresponds to subjective aspects of the self. Lee and Hobson (1998) administered this interview to a group of children and adolescents with autism and a matched sample of children with learning disabilities. In terms of the self-as-object, they reported fewer self-conceptualisations framed within social and interpersonal contexts as opposed to psychological and physical contexts. The authors therefore proposed specific deficits relating to interpersonal and social aspects of the self rather than a global deficit in self-conceptualisation in ASD.

In relation to the self-as-subject, unfortunately, only a qualitative analysis could be performed as both samples, possibly due to low verbal mental ages, struggled to answer the questions, provided far fewer responses in contrast to the self-as-object section, and did not demonstrate the higher developmental levels of self-conceptualisation usually displayed by typically developing individuals. The first aim of this study was to extend Lee and Hobson's (1998) findings by investigating self-as-subject ability in a higherfunctioning sample of adolescents with ASD.

It is generally held that in the typically developed population self/other knowledge tends to develop in tandem (Bosacki, 2000; Astington and Gopnik, 1988), with evidence suggesting that these two abilities may be related in autism (Hulburt et al., 1994). However, previous research has conceptualised self/other knowledge as separate phenomena, focusing on developmental associations (i.e., Frith and Happè, 1999). A major criticism of such approaches is that they fail to consider more inter-subjective accounts, which emphasise the developmental mediating role of interpersonal processes in the development of self-consciousness. For example, Hobson (2002) proposes that the ability to take another's attitude towards oneself and to the world, and to identify with another, serves as a necessary condition from which a fully reflective relationship with oneself develops. As such, the capacity for experiencing self-through-other (p. 106) mediates, according to Hobson, the developmental course of the self. The second aim of this study was to investigate the ability to conceptualise the self through others in autism.

In view of previous studies (Hulbert, Happè \& Frith, 1994; Lee and Hobson, 1998; Losh and Capps, 2003) and in light of Bruner's observation that individuals with autism tend to provide un-agentive accounts of 'themselves and their lives' (Bruner, 1994, p. 48), it was predicted that selfunderstanding would be reduced in autism. On the basis of the noted difficulties in social/inter-personal engagements individuals with autism display, it was predicted that the ASD sample would have difficulty in conceptualising the self-through-others' perspectives.

# Method 

## Design

A mixed design was employed with group (ASD vs. TD) as the betweenparticipants factor and self-through-other and self-understanding (both agency vs. distinctiveness vs. continuity) as the within-participants factors.

## Participants

Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the University of the West of England's Ethics Committee. Sixteen adolescent males with ASD were recruited from two special needs schools specifically catering for individuals with ASD. All had received a diagnosis of ASD by experienced clinicians. Participants were individually matched to a sample of 16 typically adolescents (TD) on the basis of chronological and verbal mental age (VMA) $\mathrm{t}(30)=.396, p=.695 ; \mathrm{t}(30)=.423, p=.676$, respectively). VMA was measured with the British Picture Vocabulary Scale 2nd ed. (Dunnet al., 1997). See Table 1 for participants' characteristics. Following Lee and Hobson (1998) mean length of utterance (MLU) was calculated from participants first 50 utterances. MLU was significantly different across groups $(\mathrm{t}(30)=4.3$, $p<.01)$.

## Materials and procedure

Children were tested in a quiet room in their school. The self-as-subject section of Damon and Hart's (1988) self-understanding interview was administered. Two questions were asked for each self-understanding category (agency, distinctiveness, continuity), and probe questions were administered following each response. The order in which each of the three categories was administered was counterbalanced across participants. Following each question, participants were asked a self-through-other question to evaluate participants' understanding of what other people would believe about the

# Scoring 

Participants' responses to the self-understanding questions were segmented into 'chunks' for analysis. These chunks were scored using Damon and Hart's (1988) manual, which assigns scores between 1 and 4 . To prevent over inflation of scores, this range was extended to $0-4$, to include instances where participants were simply unable to provide a response or stated 'I don't know'. Self-through-other questions were analysed using a coding scheme that assessed the ability to explicitly formulate the content of the other's beliefs. These scores ranged from 0 to 2 . For a detailed description of these criteria and examples of responses see Table 2.

Participants' responses were jointly coded by the first two authors. For reliability purposes an independent coder, blind to diagnoses and predictions of the study, coded responses for $25 \%$ of the sample ( 8 participants, 4 from each group). Weighted Kappa tests revealed moderate to high levels of inter-rater reliability (Self: agency: $\mathrm{K}=.93$; continuity $\mathrm{K}=.76$; distinctiveness: $\mathrm{K}=.81$; Self-through-other: agency: $\mathrm{K}=.94$; continuity $\mathrm{K}=.76$; distinctiveness: $\mathrm{K}=.86$ ).

## Results

## Self-understanding

Chi-square tests revealed that the developmental levels attained by both groups were significantly different for agency, but not distinctiveness or continuity $\left(\chi^{2}(4)=11.72, p=.020 ; \chi^{2}(4)=5.60, p>.05 ; \chi^{2}(4)=3.49\right.$, $p>.05$, respectively). As shown in Figure 1, both groups of participants found the agency questions more challenging as reflected by the number of 0 scores. ASD participants were unable to respond to distinctiveness and continuity questions in $14.3 \%$ of cases and TD participants in $4.7 \%$ of cases. In striking contrast, $37.5 \%$ of ASD participants, compared to $25 \%$ of TD participants ( $31 \%$ for both groups combined), were unable to provide self-conceptualisations in terms of agency. Therefore, it appears that whilst both groups found providing self-conceptualisations in terms of agency challenging, this tendency was greater in ASD.

In particular, the ASD group provided no responses at the highest level for the agency questions, in contrast to $12.5 \%$ of responses from the TD group. Furthermore, only $6.3 \%$ of ASD responses made reference to communication with others (level 3), in comparison to $25 \%$ of TD responses. Rather, ASD responses were greater for levels 1 and 2, representing $56.2 \%$

of responses, whilst this was the case for $34.3 \%$ of the TD group (see Table 2 for description of levels). Interestingly, the ASD group provided more responses at the highest levels than TD participants for both continuity (14 ASD; 11 TD) and distinctiveness ( 11 ASD; 9 TD). Continuity scores for both groups seemed to be concentrated at levels 2 and 4 , representing $75 \%$ of all responses, compared to levels 0,1 , and 3 combined ( $25 \%$ of all responses).

# Self-through-other 

Before reporting these results it is important to note that out of the 96 questions scheduled to be presented to the ASD group only 78 questions were asked (approx. $81 \%$ ). This was largely due to attention difficulties and the repetitive nature of the interview which some participants with ASD found challenging. Missing scores spread evenly across self-understanding categories and participants. A summary of scores can be seen in Figure 2.

A further series of chi-square analyses showed a significant difference in the distribution of scores across groups in all three categories (A: $\chi^{2}(2)$, $=6.44, \mathrm{p}=.04 ; \mathrm{C}: \chi^{2}(2)=6.80, \mathrm{p}=.033 ; \mathrm{D}: \chi^{2}(2)=9.85, \mathrm{p}=.007$. Participants with ASD showed significant difficulty with the self-throughother questions with $49.4 \%$ of ASD responses obtaining 0 scores in contrast to $20.8 \%$ in the TD sample. This difficulty is also evidenced in that only $35.1 \%$ of ASD responses, in contrast to $69.8 \%$ in the TD sample, were identified as obtaining the maximum score. Similar percentages could be observed for responses that alluded indirectly to other people's beliefs (ASD $=15.5 \% ; \mathrm{TD}=9.4 \%)$.

# Discussion 

The present study suggests that, overall, adolescents with ASD selfconceptualise to a similar level as TD adolescents. It appears, however, that adolescents with ASD have a specific difficulty with the formation of selfconceptualisations relating to agency; that is, the formation, influences, and control of the self. In line with predictions, individuals with ASD were also less able to imagine how a significant other would perceive them across these categories.

The specific difficulty relating to agency could be related to more basic disruptions in the pre-conceptual experience and awareness of one's agency (Russell, 1996, 1997; although see Williams and Happè, 2009). However, the present operationalisation of agency refers to participants' understanding of the volitional and contingent conditions of their development, thus, conceptualising agency at the level of identity and selfhood, as opposed to a 'pre-theoretical' capacity. Whilst such prior 'pre-theoretical' disruptions may be related to difficulties in conceptualisation of oneself in terms of agency, one would expect such difficulties to also have an impact on the other two categories.

A more appropriate explanation locates such dissociation within a narrative framework. Whilst the categories of continuity and distinctiveness questioned the participants about the actuality of their past or current self-characteristics, the questions for agency included questions requiring participants to engage in a simulative style of reasoning characterised by subjunctive, imaginative, and projective/retrospective narrative conceptualisations (i.e., How could you become different?). Such processes are known

to be disrupted ASD (Craig and Baron-Cohen, 1999; Boucher, 2007; Hutto, 2003). This, together with the difficulties found in the active formation of a social identity during adolescence in ASD (i.e., Willey, 1999; Williams, 2003), may suggest that disruptions in the ability to identify with the conceptual attitudes of others (treating self-as-other) leads to a disrupted ability to engage in conceptual self-identification; that is, to conceptually relate to oneself in a dialogically maturated fashion.

Furthermore, such concerns may partially account for the finding that the ASD group provided slightly higher (14) responses at the highest level for continuity ( $\mathrm{TD}=11$ ), and may reflect a preoccupation with the comparison between past and earlier characteristics of the self. Future research needs to investigate the possibility of reciprocal effects between increased developmental experiences of unsuccessful attempts to adapt and regulate the self (particularly in relation to social contexts) and noted narrative and pragmatic difficulties in the condition.

The findings of this study highlight the importance of studying different aspects of the self in ASD. As the results demonstrate, only certain aspects of the self may be impaired in ASD. The self is not a unitary concept but is constituted by different aspects which can be investigated separately. The distinction underlying this study is that made by James (1890) between self-as-object and self-as-subject. Previous studies showing difficulties (e.g., Hulburt et al., 1994) do not explicitly use this, or Neisser's (1988), distinction of the different aspects of the self and it is therefore difficult to make direct comparisons between different studies. Future research is needed to systematically investigate different aspects of self, in both typical development and ASD, in order to get a comprehensive understanding of the pattern of difficulties and strengths present in ASD.

This study also explored Hobson's (2002) proposal that identifying with the perspectives of others mediates the ability to adopt a 'distancing' perspective upon the self and to self-conceptualise. Whilst this proposal specifically relates to the development of conceptual abilities through preconceptual affective-conative engagements between the infant, caregiver and world, the present study has focused upon the status of a conceptual analogue to such identification, whereby participants were asked to identify with the beliefs of another in relation to the self.

Given that the ASD group were notably less proficient at conceptualising self-through-other it is surprising that they demonstrated selfconceptualisations of a developmentally similar level to the TD group for distinctiveness and continuity. Due to the nature of the data it was not possible to investigate the predictive relationships between self and self-through-other and thus no firm conclusions may be drawn regarding the relationships between the two. More importantly, however, the nature of

the self-through-other questions required complex inferential processes which may not be required to take others' attitudes towards the self. ${ }^{1}$ Mean length of utterance (MLU) was significantly lower in the ASD group, especially so for self-through-other responses. Unfortunately, it was not possible to re-analyse the data with subgroups matched for MLU; therefore the results need to be taken with caution. Future research is needed to address this problem.

Alternatively, certain kinds of self-conceptualisation may not be reliant upon being able to identify with the beliefs of others as directed to oneself. In this sense, the self in ASD may be more akin to the traditional Cartesian conception of the mind; whilst being able to self-conceptualise to a high level, they may be less able to incorporate and utilise self-relevant information, both from and within social contexts, which may lead to an idiosyncratic self-understanding and lead to an increased incidence of inaccurate beliefs about the self. This in turn may lead to further difficulties with the embedding and direction of oneself within second-person engagements and social contexts; thus contributing to the reported sense of alienation, estrangement and loneliness (Whitehouse et al., 2009), and hence a strongly defined sense of distinctiveness from others - as demonstrated by the ASD group.

In conclusion, whereas the ability to self-conceptualise in terms of continuity and distinctiveness may be relatively intact in autism, there seems to be a specific difficulty with self-conceptualisations pertaining to agency. Future research will need to identify the pattern of deficits relating to self in autism by making more explicit the distinction between different aspects of self. In relation to our understanding of the extent to which intersubjective processes afford the epistemic and affective constitution of selfhood and reflection, future research is also required to investigate the developmental relationships between both pre-conceptual and conceptual forms of first-person self-consciousness and second-person engagements.
